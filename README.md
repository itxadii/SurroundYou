## 🏗️ Architecture & System Design

### High-Level Architecture

The platform implements a **loosely-coupled, event-driven microservices architecture** optimized for scalability and cost efficiency.

**[View Interactive Architecture Diagram →](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/5b01e82b-cbf1-42ae-a722-8bcdffeeb5cb/edit?viewport_loc=-718%2C-178%2C2860%2C1175%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_9a3b2110-38a5-4215-806b-d29cf94e9360)**

### Request Flow

```
User Upload → API Gateway → Lambda (Pre-signed URL) → S3 Upload
    ↓
S3 Event → EventBridge → Fargate Task → Audio Processing → S3 (Processed)
    ↓
Frontend Polling → Lambda (Download URL) → User Download
```

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. **Frontend Layer** (React + Amplify)
- Single-page application with responsive UI
- Direct S3 uploads via pre-signed URLs (bypasses server limits)
- Polling mechanism for async processing status
- Client-side error handling and retry logic

#### 2. **API Gateway Layer** (Lambda Functions)
- **Upload Endpoint:** Generates time-limited S3 pre-signed URLs
- **Download Endpoint:** Provides secure access to processed files
- **Validation:** Input sanitization and file type verification
- Fully managed, auto-scaling API infrastructure

#### 3. **Event Processing Layer** (EventBridge)
- Captures S3 `ObjectCreated` events in real-time
- Routes events to appropriate compute targets
- Dead-letter queue (DLQ) for failed event capture and debugging
- Enables future extensibility (SNS notifications, analytics, etc.)

#### 4. **Compute Layer** (AWS Fargate on ECS)
- **Serverless containers:** No EC2 instance management required
- **On-demand execution:** Tasks spin up only when triggered
- **Resource optimization:** Allocated CPU/memory per task definition
- **Platform isolation:** Linux containers ensure consistent runtime

#### 5. **Processing Pipeline** (Dockerized Python Application)

**Core Dependencies:**
- `boto3` - AWS SDK for S3 interactions
- `numpy` - High-performance numerical computations
- `scipy` - Digital signal processing algorithms
- `pydub` - Audio format conversion and manipulation
- `pedalboard` - Professional-grade audio effects processing
- `ffmpeg` - Audio codec handling

**Processing Steps:**
1. Download source file from S3
2. Convert to WAV format for processing
3. Apply 8D spatial audio transformation (binaural panning + HRTF simulation)
4. Encode to MP3 with optimized bitrate
5. Upload processed file to S3 `processed/` prefix
6. Cleanup temporary files and terminate

#### 6. **Storage Layer** (Amazon S3)
- **Source bucket:** User uploads with lifecycle policies
- **Processed bucket:** Output files with presigned download access
- **Encryption:** Server-side encryption (SSE-S3) at rest
- **Versioning:** Optional version control for audit trails

#### 7. **Observability** (CloudWatch)
- Container logs aggregation
- Task execution metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring dashboards

## 🔥 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge #1: Lambda Deployment Size Constraints
**Problem:** Initial Lambda-based design exceeded 250MB uncompressed limit due to scientific libraries (`numpy`, `scipy`, `ffmpeg`).

**Solution:** 
- Migrated to containerized architecture on AWS Fargate
- Eliminated deployment size restrictions (up to 10GB container support)
- Maintained serverless benefits (no server provisioning)

**Impact:** Enabled use of full-featured audio processing libraries without compromises.

---

### Challenge #2: IAM Permission Chains
**Problem:** Complex multi-service permission requirements:
- EventBridge → ECS (`ecs:RunTask`)
- ECS Task → ECR (`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`, `ecr:BatchGetImage`)
- ECS Task → S3 (`s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`)
- EventBridge → ECS (`iam:PassRole` for task and execution roles)

**Solution:**
- Separated **Task Role** (application permissions) from **Execution Role** (infrastructure permissions)
- Configured EventBridge with `iam:PassRole` for both roles
- Implemented least-privilege policies with explicit resource ARNs

**Impact:** Secure, auditable permission model following AWS best practices.

---

### Challenge #3: Cross-Platform Docker Compatibility
**Problem:** Docker image built on Windows (ARM64 architecture) failed on Linux Fargate runtime.

**Error:**
```
exec /usr/local/bin/python: exec format error
```

**Solution:**
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t surroundyou:latest .
```

**Impact:** Ensured consistent runtime behavior across development and production environments.

---

### Challenge #4: Silent Event Processing Failures
**Problem:** Fargate tasks weren't launching; EventBridge showed "Invoked" but no CloudWatch logs appeared.

**Root Cause:** EventBridge couldn't pass IAM roles to ECS due to missing `iam:PassRole` permission.

**Solution:**
- Configured Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) on EventBridge rule
- Inspected failed events in SQS for detailed error messages
- Added missing `iam:PassRole` for both `TaskRoleArn` and `ExecutionRoleArn`

**Impact:** Reduced debugging time from hours to minutes with proper error visibility.

---

### Challenge #5: Amplify Build Environment Conflicts
**Problem:** API deployment failed with Python runtime mismatches and Amazon Linux version conflicts.

**Solution:**

## 📊 Performance & Cost Metrics

### Processing Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Processing Time** | 30-60 seconds per file |
| **Concurrent Tasks** | Auto-scales to 100+ (configurable) |
| **Task CPU** | 1 vCPU |
| **Task Memory** | 2 GB |
| **Cold Start Overhead** | ~15 seconds (ECR pull + container init) |

### Cost Analysis
| Component | Cost per 1K Conversions |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Lambda (API)** | ~$0.02 (2 invocations × 1K files) |
| **Fargate Tasks** | ~$0.65 (1 vCPU, 2GB, 45s avg) |
| **S3 Storage** | ~$0.10 (assumes 5MB avg file size) |
| **Data Transfer** | ~$0.15 (ingress free, egress charged) |
| **EventBridge** | ~$0.01 |
| **API Gateway** | ~$0.04 |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | ~$0.03 |
| **Total** | **~$1.00 per 1,000 conversions** |

*Pricing based on ap-south-1 region. Actual costs vary by region and usage patterns.*

### Scalability
- **Vertical:** Task size adjustable (0.25 vCPU - 4 vCPU)
- **Horizontal:** ECS service scales from 0 to cluster limits
- **Storage:** S3 scales infinitely with no provisioning

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Cloud Architecture Principles
- **Decoupling services** reduces blast radius and improves maintainability
- **Event-driven patterns** enable async workflows and better scalability
- **Managed services** (Fargate, Lambda) reduce operational overhead significantly
- **Right-sizing compute** (Lambda vs Fargate) based on workload characteristics

### AWS-Specific Insights
- **IAM debugging** requires understanding Task Role vs Execution Role semantics
- **EventBridge DLQs** are critical for debugging distributed event flows
- **Cross-region considerations** impact latency and data transfer costs
- **Container platforms** matter: Always specify `--platform linux/amd64` for Fargate

### DevOps Best Practices
- **Infrastructure as Code** prevents configuration drift (future enhancement)
- **Logging strategies** must be planned upfront (CloudWatch Logs retention, filtering)
- **Error handling** at every layer: network, permissions, runtime
- **Cost monitoring** should be baked into architecture decisions early

### Real-World Engineering
- **Pivot decisively** when constraints block progress (Lambda → Fargate)
- **Debug systematically** using AWS service integration points (DLQs, CloudWatch Insights)
- **Document assumptions** about IAM, networking, and service limits
- **Test cross-platform** builds before production deployment
